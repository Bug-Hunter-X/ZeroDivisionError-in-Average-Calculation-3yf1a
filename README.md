This repository demonstrates a common Python error: the ZeroDivisionError. The bug.py file contains code that calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, it fails when the input list is empty, resulting in a ZeroDivisionError. The bugSolution.py file provides a corrected version of the code that handles the empty list case gracefully.
